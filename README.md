## What is coding golf?
[Coding Golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) is the art of solving a coding problem in the least number of characters. 

## Why do coding golf?
Although the code you write is useless in the real world due to its unmaintainability, having to think about the shortest and best way to solve a problem is really good practice, especially for beginner programmers. 

## Rules
- No looking up answers. Although you can use the internet as a reference point, we will be able to tell if you have been cheating!
- You can use any language you like. Dynamically typed languages such as Javascript, Python and Ruby are the more natural choice though as they are smaller in nature.
- If there is a tie, the first person to get the answer wins.

## Prizes
Depending on the challenge, prizes will be available. This will be whatever we have available, it may be stickers for you laptop, sweets and chocolate or the choice of which pub we attend.
