# rot13

ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter
substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the letter 13 letters after it
in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, developed in
ancient Rome.

Your challenge is to come up with some code that when given a string will
produce the rot13 equivalent. You may use any language you like, and do it in
whatever hacky way you please.
